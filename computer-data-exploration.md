# Exploration of Cohort Computer Data

The data came from here: <https://github.com/UVADS/orientation-technical/tree/main/content/dat>

## RAM

As shown by the above histogram, the most common amounts of RAM are 4-8 GB and 12-16 GB.

## CPU Cycle Rate

For the CPU's, the two most common cycle rates are 2.0-2.5 GHz and 3.0-3.5 GHz.

## Hard Drive Size

The most common hard drive sizes are 128-256 GB and 256-512 GB.

## GPU and CPU Cores

For GPU cores, most fall in the range of 0-2 cores. For CPU cores, the most common ranges are 0-2 cores and 2-4 cores.

## Operating System

For operating system, MacOS is easily the most common followed by Windows. Linux was a distant third. I found this result surprising given how prevalent Windows computers are.

## GPU Description
There is not a great way to display the data on GPU types. After reviewing the data, a wide variety of companies are represented including Intel, Nvidia, AMD, and Apple.
